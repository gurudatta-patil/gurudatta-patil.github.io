An AI-driven PvP storytelling experience that blends narrative generation and real-time competition. I architected the Go backend services, WebSocket infrastructure (Protobuf), Redis coordination layer, and LLM runtime that powers branching narratives, seasonal leaderboards, and gacha-based progression. The cross-platform Flutter client streams low-latency updates from Kubernetes pods deployed on GCP, supporting 100,000+ concurrent socket connections and 137+ daily active beta users.
